# Welcome to My Blog

This is my **first blog post** using markdown with Next.js!

## Why I Built This Site

I wanted a fast, SEO-optimized portfolio that showcases my work and shares my knowledge.

### Tech Stack

- Next.js 15
- React
- Markdown for content
- CSS Modules for styling

## Code Example
```javascript
const greeting = "Hello World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

That's all for now!
