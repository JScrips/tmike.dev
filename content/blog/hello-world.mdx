# Hello World

Welcome to my corner of the internet. If you're reading this, you've either stumbled upon my portfolio or you're me, checking if the blog actually works. Either way, *hello*.

## Why a Blog?

Every developer eventually reaches a point where they think, "I should start a blog." For most of us, that thought is followed by setting up the perfect static site generator, obsessing over typography, and then never writing a single post.

I'm determined to break that cycle. Mostly.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Web Development** - React, TypeScript, Next.js, and whatever shiny new thing catches my attention
- **Learning in Public** - Sharing what I learn as I learn it
- **Side Projects** - The graveyard of unfinished projects and the occasional survivor
- **Hot Takes** - Opinions that may or may not age well

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with:

```typescript
const stack = {
  framework: "Next.js 15",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS v4",
  content: "MDX",
  hosting: "TBD",
  coffee: "excessive"
};
```

## Let's Connect

If anything I write resonates with you (or if you vehemently disagree), feel free to reach out. I'm always up for a good conversation about code, design, or why tabs are objectively better than spaces.

*Just kidding about that last part. Please don't @ me.*

Thanks for reading. More posts coming soon.
