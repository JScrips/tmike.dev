# Murry Crimmuh from the Year of Our GPU Overlords, 2025

Another year down. Genuinely grateful for the people in my life, the lessons learned,
and the fact thatI don't need to buy RAM any time soon.

It's been a wild ride watching and being a part of tech this year. Bruh.
NVIDIA' has some real interesting tactics in the GPU market.
My wallet wishes their pricing strategy showed a bit more Christmas spirit.
The AI acceleration we're seeing is going mach-speed. For better or worse.

Big Tech's push toward AI infrastructure has been something to witness.
Data centers expanding, compute costs rising, and yes, DDR5 prices climbing right along with them.

As a gamer, I have to say -- Yay....


But honestly? Grateful to be working in this field during such an interesting time.
The challenges are real, the tech is advancing faster than ever, and there's something oddly disorienting
about collectively navigating this absurd, exciting timeline together.

Here's to 2025: GGWP, No Re. GLHF 2026.

Murry Crimmuh. 🎄

*P.S. —GPU discounts are welcome.*
