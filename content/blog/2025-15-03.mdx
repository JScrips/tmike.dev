You know that feeling when you refresh your email and see a message
from corporate communications with "Important Update" in the subject
line? That pre-doom sensation where you *know* it's about to be some
bullshit, but you gotta read it anyway?

Yeah. That was my day.

**Subject: RTO -- LOL GG**

JPMorgan Chase—one of the largest banks in the world, with all the resources and data analytics money
can buy—has decided that hybrid work don't work. Five days in-office.
No exceptions. Yay.

The same hybrid arrangement that encouraged me during my interview? Nope. Bye Bye.

And no, lunch isn't free. BRUH.

## Let's Talk About What This Actually Is

This isn't about productivity. Let's be honest.

This is about:

1. **Real estate commitments** - They've got entire buildings in Manhattan they need to justify
2. **Executive preference** - Old-school banking culture where "serious work" happens at a desk they can see
3. **Control** - Managers who never learned to evaluate output instead of hours visible

The official communication mentioned "collaboration" and "culture". Of course it did bruh.
Corporate word salad that means "do it or else".

## Math Break

I'm doing this for future me, so that I can get mad every time I read this:

**Money Loss (Monthly)**

- Gas: ~$280 (60-mile round trip, 22 commute days)
- Tolls: $88 (DNT Bridge isn't free, shockingly)
- Car maintenance increase: ~$250 (oil changes, wear and tear)
- Lunch: $220 (because no, it's not free LOL - $10-12/day average)
- Coffee/snacks: $80 (the office coffee tastes like depression)

**Total: ~$918/month**

That's $11,016 per year. That's a *significant* effective pay cut they just handed me with zero negotiation.

## The Code-Switching Calculation

Here's the part they'll never put in a corporate memo: the mental tax of being a Black developer in a predominantly white corporate banking environment.

Working hybrid meant I could:

- Exist more authentically during remote days
- Skip the "how was your weekend" performance
- Avoid the microaggressions that come with being the only Black dev in most meetings
- Not monitor every facial expression and reaction
- Actually *breathe* two days a week

Now? That's gone. It's back to full-time corporate persona. Five days a week of:

- Carefully neutral reactions to casual racism disguised as "jokes"
- The "you're so well-spoken" comments
- Being asked to speak for all Black people when DEI topics come up
- The suspicious looks when I badge into certain floors
- Watching white colleagues get praised for ideas I suggested last sprint

And before anyone jumps in with "not all workplaces"—bruh, it's *banking*. The industry that literally invented redlining. The culture is what it is.

I'm tired.
