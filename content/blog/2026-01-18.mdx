I've been translating corporate speak for six years now, and honestly, it's exhausting.

Every Teams message, every email, every standup—it's like everyone got the same AI chip installed in their brains.

So here's my field guide. Your Rosetta Stone for surviving another Tuesday.

## The Classics

**"Let's circle back on this"**  
 I don't want to deal with this right now, and I'm banking on you forgetting about it entirely.  


**"I'll ping you offline"**  
I don't want witnesses for this conversation.  


**"This is a high-level overview"**  
** I don't actually know the details and I'm hoping you don't either.  

**"Let's take this offline"**  
** You're making me look bad in front of people who matter, please stop.  
<hr/>
## The Passive-Aggressive Tier

**"Per my last email..."**  
** Learn to fucking read.  

**"I want to make sure we're aligned"**  
** You're about to do something I don't approve of, and I need to stop you without explicitly telling you no.  

**"Let's be mindful of..."**  
You're doing something wrong, but I'm too polite/scared/corporate to say it directly.  

**"That's a great point, but..."**  
That's a terrible point and here's why you're wrong.

## The Gaslighting Collection

**"We're all wearing multiple hats here"**  
 We're understaffed and you're about to do three jobs for one salary.  

**"We're a family here"**  
 We're going to guilt trip you into unpaid overtime and emotional labor.  
<sub>P.S: Families don't lay you off when Q4 projections miss.</sub> 

**"This is a growth opportunity"**  
This is going to suck, but we're rebranding it as career development.  

**"We value work-life balance"**  
We will absolutely message you at 9 PM and expect a response.  
<hr/>
## The Meeting Menaces

**"Let's put a pin in that"**  
 I'm not saying no, but I'm also never saying yes.

**"Can everyone see my screen?"**  
 I haven't prepared for this meeting and I'm stalling.  

**"I'll have to check with my team"**  
 I have the authority to decide this right now, but I want plausible deniability later.  

**"Let's timebox this discussion"**  
 I'm about to shut down this conversation regardless of whether we've solved anything.  
<hr/>
## Tech Talk

**"This is a known issue"**  
This bug is old enough to vote and we're never fixing it.  

**"We're refactoring for maintainability"**  
The original code was such a dumpster fire that we have to rewrite it, but we can't admit that publicly.


**"This follows our coding standards"**
I read the linter config once in 2019.  

**"It's a simple change"**
I have no idea how complex this actually is.  
<hr/>

## Politics

**"That's above my pay grade"**  
 I know the answer but I'm not risking my neck to tell you.  


**"I'll loop in [senior person]"**  
 I need backup because this is about to go sideways.  


**"We need to be strategic about this"**  
 I'm about to deprioritize your thing for something I care about more.

**"Let's align with leadership on this"**  
 I'm not making this decision because someone higher up might disagree and I don't want the heat.

*Also, if your manager reads this and gets mad: I don't know you. This is satire. Please don't fire me, I have student loans.*
