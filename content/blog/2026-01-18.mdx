I've been translating corporate speak for six years now, and I've realized something: we're all doing it. Every single one of us learned this second language out of necessity, and now we're all fluent in saying everything *except* what we actually mean.

It's the professional equivalent of Fist Pounding A High Five, or vice versa.

## The Classics (AKA The Safe Zone)

**"Let's circle back on this"**  
 This isn't urgent enough for right now, and we both know it. Let's acknowledge it exists and deal with it when we have actual bandwidth.  

**"I'll ping you offline"**  
This conversation needs context/nuance that doesn't work well in a group setting.  


**"This is a high-level overview"**  
 I'm giving you the executive summary because either (a) you don't need all the details yet, or (b) I'm still figuring out the details myself.  


**"Let's take this offline"**  
 We're either going in circles, getting too detailed for this forum, or this is turning into a debate that doesn't need 12 witnesses.

## The Passive-Aggressive Tier (Use Sparingly, With Love)

**"Per my last email..."**  
I already answered this, and I'm trying *really hard* to be patient right now.  


**"I want to make sure we're aligned"**  
 I think we might be heading in different directions, and I'd like to sync up before we build the wrong thing.  


**"Let's be mindful of..."**  
 Gentle course correction incoming.  


**"That's a great point, but..."**  
 I appreciate the input, and also here's why we can't do it that way.

## The Reality Check Collection (Not Gaslighting, Just... Capitalism)

**"We're all wearing multiple hats here"**  
 Our team is lean and scrappy. Sometimes that's exciting, sometimes that's exhausting.  


**"We're a family here"**  
 We care about each other and want a positive culture....unless  

**"This is a growth opportunity"**  
This task is challenging and outside your current scope.  

**"We value work-life balance"**  
We _say_ we care about boundaries.

## The Meeting Menaces (We've All Been There)

**"Let's put a pin in that"**  
This is worth discussing, but not right now in this context.  


**"Can everyone see my screen?"**  
I'm either (a) new to screen sharing, (b) stalling for 5 seconds, or (c) my screen share legit failed.  


**"I'll have to check with my team"**  
 I don't want to commit without consensus, or I genuinely need input from people who know more than me.  

**"Let's timebox this discussion"**  
 We need to respect everyone's time and make a decision.

## Tech Talk (Because We're All Guilty)

**"This is a known issue"**  
 We're aware of it and it's in the backlog somewhere between "eventually" and "never."  

**"We're refactoring for maintainability"**  
 The code works but it's getting hard to work *with*, so we're cleaning it up.  


**"This follows our coding standards"**  
I ran the linter and it passed. (Hopefully we have good standards.)  


**"It's a simple change"**  
It *seems* simple from the outside.

## The Politics (AKA Navigating Hierarchy Without Losing Your Mind)

**"That's above my pay grade"**  
 I literally don't have the authority or context to make this call.  

**"I'll loop in [senior person]"**  
This needs visibility or approval from someone with more context/authority.  

**"We need to be strategic about this"**  
Let's think bigger picture instead of just reacting.  

**"Let's align with leadership on this"**  
 This decision has organizational impact and needs buy-in from above.

**P.S.** If you took this personally let's put a pin in it and circle back. ;)
